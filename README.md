# DonkeyX (based on [donkeycar](http://donkeycar.com))

DonkeyX is a fork project based on [Donkeycar](http://donkeycar.com) started by Will Roscoe and Adam Conway in 2017.

In this project things are done a bit differently, but all of the core components are based on original Donkeycar.

Wiki includes all of the documentation needed to get going!
